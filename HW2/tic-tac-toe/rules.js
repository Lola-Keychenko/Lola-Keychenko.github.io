We store the move of player 1 as '1' and player 2 as '0'. So after the above two moves the state should look like

TODO - Rule 1
This is the first method you'll implement. This method is called when the Begin Play button is clicked.
The method should do all the validations as stated in rule 1.
1. Verify if the player names are empty or not. Raise an alert if they are empty.
2. If the field are empty don't start the game. This just means the function will return and do nothing. The 'started' flag will not be modified.
3. If all verification is successful, disable the name fields and update the player moves as shown in the image.
4. If all verification is successful, update the turn information on the page. (See the source code and image). And set the started flag to true.(this will help you track at any instant if the game is in start state or not.)
5. Once game has started, Handle multiple clicks on begin play.

1. The reset play button should reset the whole game.(At any time when reset is clicked - All the three text boxes should be cleared and Turn should be set to the default message.)
2. The text boxes for entering name should be enablled back.

TODO - Rule 3
This is the last method you'll implement. This method is called everytime a move has been player( Play button was clicked).
The method should do all the things as stated in rule 2.
1. The moves should be validated can only be these ["A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2", "B3", "C1", "C2", "C3"]
2. Invalid moves should be reported by an alert message.(You are encorraged to use Modal which you learned in HW1 - Usage is not mandatory.)
3. If the move is a valid move, the grid should be updated with the correct move (Player 1 is always - 'X', and Player 2 is always 'O' (This is not zero!)) - The turn information should also be updated
	Hint: Use the turn variable to figure out who is currently playing. Use to toggle method to change moves.
4. A move should always be a valid move. (Example: If say a move was made in already filled cell, it should be invalidated with an alert.)
5. If the game has not started, clicking on <b>Play</b> should give an alert "The game has not started."<br/>
6. After any move, the state of the table should be validated.(see the document attached in the homework) 
   If the there is winner - Show it in an alert message - (Ex - Winner is X or O) - Displaying name is not important. <br/>
7. The game should reset itself once a winner is determined.<br/>
8. After all the moves have exhausted, you're not required to display any message. (It should be obvious to Reset play.)<br/>
